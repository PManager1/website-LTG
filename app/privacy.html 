	https://www.Liberty Trust Group .com/terms

This agreement was written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.

Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Liberty Trust Group  Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Liberty Trust Group , as well as Liberty Trust Group  brands, products and services, which we call the “Liberty Trust Group  Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the Liberty Trust Group  Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Liberty Trust Group  works.
Because Liberty Trust Group  provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.
Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Liberty Trust Group  to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

Sharing Your Content and Information

You own all of the content and information you post on Liberty Trust Group , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Liberty Trust Group  (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)
When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Liberty Trust Group , to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Liberty Trust Group , but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
