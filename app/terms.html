Responsibility for User-Generated Content Posted on or Through this Site

You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any UGC.

This means that you, not Liberty Trust Group  LLC, are entirely responsible for all UGC that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the UGC you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permission to post it.

Because we do not control the UGC posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that UGC.

You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it. You own the copyright in any original UGC you post. We do not claim any copyrights in UGC. However, by using this Site you are granting us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive, fully paid, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, publish, transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and commercialize UGC you post in any and all media or form of communication whether now existing or hereafter developed, without obtaining additional consent, without restriction, notification, or attribution, and without compensating you in any way, and to authorize others to do the same. For this reason, we ask that you not post any UGC that you do not wish to license to us, including any photographs, videos, confidential information, or product ideas.

Liberty Trust Group  LLC and its Partners reserve the right to display advertisements in connection with your UGC and to use your UGC for advertising and promotional purposes.

We may disclose and/or remove User-Generated Content. Liberty Trust Group  LLC has certain rights. We have the right (but do not assume the obligation) to:

• monitor all UGC;
• require that you avoid certain subjects;
• remove or block any UGC at any time without notice at our sole and absolute discretion;
• disclose any UGC and the identity of the user who posted it in response to a subpoena or whenever we believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order, to prevent or investigate a possible crime or other violation of law, to protect the rights of Liberty Trust Group  LLC or others, or to enforce these Terms of Use; and
• terminate your access to and use of this Site, or to modify, edit or block your transmissions thereto, for any reason and in our sole discretion.

You agree that our exercise of such discretion shall not render us the owners of UGC you post, and that you will retain ownership thereof as described above.

Restrictions on User-Generated Content. It is a condition of these Terms of Use that you do not:

• upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available
o any UGC that is unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, racially disparaging, indecent, or invasive of another’s privacy;
o any UGC that constitutes or encourages activity illegal under criminal or civil law;

o any UGC that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information or proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
o any UGC that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including UGC which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights, confidentiality rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any individual, living or deceased, or any legal entity;
o any UGC that contains the image, name or likeness of anyone other than yourself, unless (i) that person is at least eighteen years old and you have first obtained his/her express permission or (ii) that person is under eighteen years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian;
o any request for or solicitation of any personal or private information from any individual to the extent such request is not consistent with the networking goals of this Site, promotions or marketing, or which otherwise has a commercial purpose.


Any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; or

• impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; or
• violate any local, state, national or international law, rule or regulation.

By posting User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the UGC and have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the UGC is accurate, and (iii) you have read and understood—and your UGC fully complies with—these Terms of Use and applicable laws and will not cause injury to any person or entity.

Removal of Content

In general. You can seek removal of objectionable UGC, and lodge complaints against particular users, by contacting us at http://www.Liberty Trust Group .com/contact. We will endeavor to review such requests and to remove UGC and users that we determine should be removed, in our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms of Use and applicable law. However, by providing a mechanism for the submission of complaints, we make no promises that we will review all such complaints or that we will take any action in response to such complaints. Please be aware, however, that if the UGC has already been distributed to other websites or published in other media, we will not be able to recapture and delete it. Also, a back-up or residual copy of the UGC we remove from this Site may remain on back-up servers.

Violation of copyrights. Liberty Trust Group  LLC does not knowingly violate or permit others to violate the copyrights of others. We will promptly remove or disable access to material that we know is infringing or if we become aware of circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.

If you are requesting removal of content because of a violation of your copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.

• your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and, if you are not the owner of the copyright, the name of the owner; and
• a written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
• a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

Your statement must be addressed as follows:

Fees and Payments

Liberty Trust Group  LLC members can elect to upgrade their account to a PRO or Plus Account or to purchase another subscription service offered by Liberty Trust Group  LLC such as advertising in our Hard Money Lender Directory, where they are charged a subscription fee for the use of certain services. Liberty Trust Group  LLC reserves the right to change the fees at any time, upon notice to you. By registering for a PRO account, Plus account, or other subscription service, you agree to pay Liberty Trust Group  LLC the fees for the services applicable to the account level chosen. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate immediately.

All fees are paid in advance and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, refunds for accounts that have had access to particular services restricted, refunds for accounts that have had upgrades canceled for any reason including violations of these Terms, or refunds for months unused. However, if a user upgrades and cancels within 24 hours without using the upgraded services offered to members with a paid subscription, we will offer a full refund minus any applicable cancellation fees. We reserve the right to deactivate your access to the Services for your failure to pay applicable fees or for violations of these Terms. If you provide us with a credit card that expires during the term of these Terms of Service, we reserve the right to charge any renewal card issued to you as a replacement. You agree to promptly pay Liberty Trust Group  LLC in the event of any refusal of your credit card issuer to pay any amount to Liberty Trust Group  LLC for any reason. You agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorneys’ fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In the event you fail to pay any amount when due, Liberty Trust Group  LLC may immediately suspend or terminate your access to any or all of our services.

Your PRO, Plus, or other subscription will renew automatically, unless you terminate it at http://www.Liberty Trust Group  LLC.com/settings/pro or for a service, on the applicable cancelation page, OR if we terminate it for a violation of these Terms. You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit card.

We may elect to offer free or discounted pricing for use of the PRO or PLUS services or other subscription services (a "Trial"). Once the terms of any Trial have expired, you agree that our normal billing rates shall apply. You agree to comply with any additional terms, restrictions or limitations we impose in connection with any Trial. You may not sign-up for multiple Accounts in order to receive additional benefits under any Trial.

The only accepted method for you to cancel your paid subscription to the Liberty Trust Group  LLC is via the account settings available through your Pro, Plus, or other account related to your subscription as mentioned in the prior paragraph. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your Pro Account at any time when you are logged into your Liberty Trust Group  LLC Pro or Plus Account by going to your account preferences and using the "Please cancel my Liberty Trust Group  LLC Pro/Plus account" link. Other subscriptions may be cancelled via the settings on the pages associated with their features. If you cancel the services before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.
